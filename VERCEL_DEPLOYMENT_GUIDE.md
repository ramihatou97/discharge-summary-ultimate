## Understanding Framework Presets on Vercel

When you deploy to Vercel, it auto-detects your framework and applies the appropriate build configuration. For React apps, you have three main options:

### Option 1: Create React App (CRA) - Current Default

**What it is**: Facebook's official React toolchain with webpack bundler

**Vercel Detection**: 
- Looks for `react-scripts` in `package.json`
- Automatically runs `npm run build`
- Serves files from `build/` directory

**Pros**:
- ✅ Zero configuration needed
- ✅ Well-established, stable
- ✅ Good documentation
- ✅ Already configured in this project

**Cons**:
- ⚠️ Slower build times (2-3 minutes)
- ⚠️ Larger bundle sizes
- ⚠️ Webpack overhead
- ⚠️ Less optimized for modern browsers
- ⚠️ No longer actively maintained by Meta

**Build Configuration**:
```json
{
  "framework": "create-react-app",
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "build"
}
```

---

### Option 2: Vite - **RECOMMENDED** ⭐

**What it is**: Modern, lightning-fast build tool using native ES modules

**Vercel Detection**: 
- Looks for `vite` in `package.json` dependencies
- Automatically runs `npm run build`
- Serves files from `dist/` directory

**Pros**:
- ✅ **10x faster builds** (30 seconds vs 3 minutes)
- ✅ **Smaller bundle sizes** (better performance)
- ✅ Hot Module Replacement (instant dev updates)
- ✅ Modern ES modules (better tree-shaking)
- ✅ Better TypeScript support
- ✅ Actively maintained
- ✅ **Perfect for Vercel** (designed for modern hosting)

**Cons**:
- ⚠️ Requires migration from CRA (minimal effort)

**Build Configuration**:
```json
{
  "framework": "vite",
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist"
}
```

---

### Option 3: Next.js - Not Applicable

**What it is**: React framework with server-side rendering

**Why not for this project**:
- ❌ Overkill for a static single-page app
- ❌ No SSR needed for this use case
- ❌ More complex deployment
- ❌ Higher costs (serverless functions)

Vite is optimized for modern hosting platforms like Vercel:
- Native ES modules = faster initial load
- Better code splitting = smaller chunks
- Tree-shaking = eliminates unused code
- Modern build targets = leverages latest browser features

### 2. **Build Speed**
Your project is educational, so you'll iterate frequently:
- **CRA**: 2-3 minute builds (painful for rapid iteration)
- **Vite**: 30 second builds (deploy changes instantly)

### 3. **Developer Experience**
- Hot Module Replacement: Changes appear instantly in dev mode
- Fast refresh: No page reload needed
- Better error messages: Easier debugging

### 4. **Future-Proof**
- Vite is actively maintained by the Vue/Vite core team
- CRA development has slowed significantly
- Industry trend: Moving from CRA to Vite

### 5. **Bundle Size**
Your medical app has lots of features (risk calculators, ML, charts):
- Vite's better tree-shaking = 30-40% smaller bundles
- Faster page loads for users
- Better mobile performance

### 6. **Already Partially Configured**
Your repo already has `vite.config.js` and the right file structure!
- Just need to update `package.json`

### Recommended: Migrate to Vite First

**Time Required**: 10 minutes

#### Step 1: Update Dependencies

```bash
cd /home/runner/work/discharge-summary-ultimate/discharge-summary-ultimate/files

# Remove CRA dependencies
npm uninstall react-scripts

# Add Vite dependencies
npm install --save-dev vite @vitejs/plugin-react
```

#### Step 2: Update package.json

Change the scripts section:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview",
    "predeploy": "npm run build",
    "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"
  }
}
```

#### Step 3: Update index.html

Move `public/index.html` to `files/index.html` (root level) and update:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Discharge Summary Generator</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script type="module" src="/src/main.jsx"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

#### Step 4: Rename Entry Point

Rename `src/index.js` to `src/main.jsx` (if not already done):

```bash
# If index.js exists and main.jsx doesn't:
mv src/index.js src/main.jsx
```

#### Step 5: Update vite.config.js

Your existing `vite.config.js` looks good! Just verify:

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  base: './', // Important for GitHub Pages
  build: {
    outDir: 'dist',
    assetsDir: 'assets',
    sourcemap: false,
    minify: 'terser',
    terserOptions: {
      compress: {
        drop_console: true,
        drop_debugger: true
      }
    }
  }
})
```

#### Step 6: Test Locally

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Test dev server
npm run dev

# Test production build
npm run build
npm run preview
```

#### Step 7: Deploy to Vercel

1. **Push changes to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Migrate to Vite for faster builds"
   git push
   ```

2. **Vercel will auto-detect Vite** and configure:
   - Framework Preset: **Vite**
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `dist`

3. **Deploy automatically** (30 seconds!)

### Current Configuration (Create React App)

The included `vercel.json` is production-ready:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "build",
  "installCommand": "npm install",
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ],
  "headers": [/* Security and caching headers */]
}
```

**You can deploy immediately** - no changes needed!

### After Migrating to Vite

If you migrate to Vite following the guide above, update `vercel.json`:

```json
