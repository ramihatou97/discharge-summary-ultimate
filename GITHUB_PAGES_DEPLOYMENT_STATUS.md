_Note: This report reflects the situation at the time of writing (October 6, 2025)._
### ✅ What's Working
- GitHub Actions "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow is configured correctly
- The workflow runs successfully on every push to `main` branch
- All workflow runs have completed successfully

### ⚠️ The Problem
**PR #5's changes are NOT reflected on the live GitHub Pages site**, even though the workflow ran successfully.

## 🔍 Technical Analysis

### Timeline of Events

   - Deploy workflow: ✅ Completed successfully

2. **PR #5 Merged** (Oct 6, 18:10 UTC)
   - Commit: `23bd7d537fd72dddf955bb58c78955d2d8b30ce0`
   - Deploy workflow: ✅ Completed successfully at 18:11:22 UTC
   - Pages deployment: ⚠️ **DID NOT COMPLETE**
   - **Status**: NOT on GitHub Pages (still showing PR #4)

### Workflow Analysis

**Deploy to GitHub Pages Workflow (`deploy.yml`):**
```

Run #2 (PR #5): ✅ Success → Pages DID NOT Update
```

**Pages Build and Deployment Workflow:**
```
Last Run: Oct 6, 18:12:17 UTC
From Commit: c44e85506d9ee150a91270c46211d0206bf0a7c8 (PR #4)
Status: ✅ Success
```

### Why This Happened

The GitHub Actions workflow successfully:
1. ✅ Built the React app from `/files` directory
2. ✅ Created the deployment artifact
3. ✅ Uploaded the artifact to GitHub Pages
4. ✅ Triggered the deployment job

However, the GitHub Pages service did not pick up the new deployment artifact, and continues to serve the older PR #4 version.

## 🎯 Solution

There are **three ways** to resolve this issue:

### Option 1: Merge This PR (Recommended)
Merging this PR will trigger a new push to `main`, which will:
1. Run the Deploy to GitHub Pages workflow again
2. Force a fresh deployment
3. Update GitHub Pages with ALL the latest changes (PR #5 + this PR)

**Action Required:**
- Merge this PR to `main` branch
- Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment
- Verify at: https://ramihatou97.github.io/discharge-summary-ultimate/

### Option 2: Manual Workflow Trigger
You can manually trigger the workflow right now:

**Steps:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/ramihatou97/discharge-summary-ultimate/actions/workflows/deploy.yml
2. Click the "Run workflow" button (top right)
3. Select branch: `main`
4. Click "Run workflow"
5. Wait 2-3 minutes for completion
6. Refresh the site with cache cleared (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Option 3: Make Any Change to Main
Push any small change to the `main` branch (even a comment) to trigger the workflow:

```bash
# Example
git checkout main
git pull
echo "# Trigger deployment" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Trigger redeployment"
git push origin main
```

PR #5 included UI/UX improvements that are currently NOT live:

These changes are in the `main` branch but not yet deployed to GitHub Pages.

## ✅ Verification Steps

After deployment completes, verify the update:

1. **Check Deployment Status:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/ramihatou97/discharge-summary-ultimate/actions
   - Confirm "Deploy to GitHub Pages" shows success
   - Confirm "pages build and deployment" shows success with latest commit SHA

2. **Test the Live Site:**
   - Visit: https://ramihatou97.github.io/discharge-summary-ultimate/
   - Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
   - Verify you see the latest changes from PR #5

3. **Check Commit SHA:**
   - Open browser dev tools (F12)
   - Look for any build metadata or version info
   - Verify it matches commit: `23bd7d537fd72dddf955bb58c78955d2d8b30ce0` (or later)
